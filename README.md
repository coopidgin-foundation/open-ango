# open-ango
A try of coopidgin based on the Angos auxlang

Uppercase.
When possible, Open-ango uses font with uppercase character identical to lowercase character (just bigger). In Open-ango, uppercase character are only use at the begin of word spelled like the english proper-name international system: family-name transcriptions, country-name transcription, city-name transcriptions…
It exists too le Open-ango transcription, of course. Example: palis-tono esa Paris.  Or tono paliso. It’s just an example. It will be checked later.
Open-ango in Open-ango is “le wi open-ango”.

Vocabulary
More word from the Pandunia lexical. The logic is: we know 30 of the vocabulary is commune between the european languages. The other 70% of the lexical should come from other commune vocabulary zones : China/Japanese/Indonesian/Hindustani/Arab/Swahili/Bantu… when possible. If not… take the bigger of the most nice sounding words…
More shorter words from every languages. And sometimes, you short the word. Example: bemo or belemo for problem. I don’t know if it’s a good example, tho :-/

(And... No s ending. It could change by poll, but at start I'd like to try without this -s ending. I think many people has stoped to go ahead wiht Angos because of this -s ending, wich is pretty poetic but in the same time, a little too much...)
